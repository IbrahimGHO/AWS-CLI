# AWS CLI S3 Operations

This README provides a quick reference guide for performing basic AWS S3 operations using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The operations covered include listing buckets, listing objects within a bucket, creating a bucket, and uploading objects to a bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:
- An AWS account with necessary permissions to perform S3 operations.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine. If you haven't set up the AWS CLI, follow the [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and [AWS CLI Configuration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

## AWS S3 Operations

### List All Buckets

To list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account, use the following command:

```sh
aws s3 ls
```
### List Objects Inside a Bucket
To list all the objects within S3 bucket.
```sh
aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
```
Replace `bucket-name` with the name of the bucket you want to list objects from.

### Create Bucket
To create a new S3 bucket, you can use the following command:
```sh
aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name
```
Replace `bucket-name` with the desired name for your new bucket.



### Upload Object
To upload a file from your local machine to an S3 bucket, you can use the following command:
```sh
aws s3 cp <file-path-in-your-pc> s3://bucket-name
```
Replace `<file-path-in-your-pc>` with the local file path of the object you want to upload, and `bucket-name` with the name of the bucket you want to upload the object to. This command will copy the specified file to the specified S3 bucket.


## Conclusion

The AWS CLI provides a convenient way to manage your S3 buckets and objects from the command line. By using these commands, you can efficiently perform tasks such as listing buckets, creating buckets, and uploading objects to S3, streamlining your workflow for managing cloud storage resources.

# AWS CLI S3 Operations

This README provides a quick reference guide for performing basic AWS S3 operations using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The operations covered include listing buckets, listing objects within a bucket, creating a bucket, and uploading objects to a bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:
- An AWS account with necessary permissions to perform S3 operations.
